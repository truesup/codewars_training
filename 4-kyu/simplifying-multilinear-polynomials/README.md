But tell that to your pc and we'll see! <br></p><p>Write a function: <code>simplify</code>, that takes a string in input, representing a <em>multilinear non-constant polynomial in integers coefficients</em> (like <code>"3x-zx+2xy-x"</code>), and returns another string as output where the same expression has been simplified in the following way ( <code>-&gt;</code> means application of <code>simplify</code>):</p><ul><li>All possible sums and subtraction of equivalent monomials ("xy==yx") has been done, e.g.:<br> <p><code>"cb+cba" -&gt; "bc+abc"</code>, <code>"2xy-yx" -&gt; "xy"</code>, <code>"-a+5ab+3a-c-2a" -&gt; "-c+5ab"</code><br><br></p></li><li>All monomials appears in order of increasing number of variables, e.g.:<br> <p><code>"-abc+3a+2ac" -&gt; "3a+2ac-abc"</code>, <code>"xyz-xz" -&gt; "-xz+xyz"</code><br><br> </p></li><li>If two monomials have the same number of variables, they appears in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographical_order" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">lexicographic order</a>, e.g.:<br> <p><code>"a+ca-ab" -&gt; "a-ab+ac"</code>, <code>"xzy+zby" -&gt;"byz+xyz"</code><br><br>  </p></li><li>There is no leading <code>+</code> sign if the first coefficient is positive, e.g.:<br> <p><code>"-y+x" -&gt; "x-y"</code>, but no restrictions for <code>-</code>:  <code>"y-x" -&gt;"-x+y"</code></p></li></ul><hr><p><strong>N.B.</strong> to keep it simplest, the string in input is restricted to represent only <em>multilinear non-constant polynomials</em>, so you won't find something like `-3+yx^2'. <strong>Multilinear</strong> means in this context: <strong>of degree 1 on each variable</strong>.</p><p><strong>Warning</strong>: the string in input can contain arbitrary variables represented by lowercase characters in the english alphabet.</p><p><strong>Good Work :)</strong></p>
