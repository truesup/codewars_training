<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a045fee46d843effa000070/train/javascript target="_blank">Factorial decomposition</a></h2><h3>5 kyu</h3><p>The aim of the kata is to decompose <code>n!</code> (factorial n) into its prime factors.</p><p>Examples:</p><pre><code>n = 12; decomp(12) -&gt; "2^10 * 3^5 * 5^2 * 7 * 11"since 12! is divisible by 2 ten times, by 3 five times, by 5 two times and by 7 and 11 only once.n = 22; decomp(22) -&gt; "2^19 * 3^9 * 5^4 * 7^3 * 11^2 * 13 * 17 * 19"n = 25; decomp(25) -&gt; 2^22 * 3^10 * 5^6 * 7^3 * 11^2 * 13 * 17 * 19 * 23</code></pre><p>Prime numbers should be in increasing order. When the exponent of a prime is 1 don't put the exponent.</p><p>Notes</p><ul><li>the function is <code>decomp(n)</code> and should return the decomposition of <code>n!</code> into its prime factors in increasing order of the primes, as a string.</li><li>factorial can be a very big number (<code>4000! has 12674 digits</code>, n can go from 300 to 4000).</li><li>In Fortran - as in any other language - the returned string is not permitted to contain any redundant trailing whitespace: you can use <code>dynamically allocated character strings</code>.</li></ul>
