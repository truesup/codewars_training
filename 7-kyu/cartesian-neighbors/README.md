Each point in a coordinate system has eight neighboring points. Provided that the grid step = 1.</p><p>It is necessary to write a function that takes a coordinate on the x-axis and y-axis and returns a list of all the neighboring points. Points inside your returned list need not be sorted (any order is valid).</p><p>For Example:</p><pre><code>* Given x = 2 and y = 2, the function should return [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)];* Given x = 5 and y = 7, the function should return [(6,7),(6,6),(6,8),(4,7),(4,6),(4,8),(5,6),(5,8)].</code></pre><p>Note that the required data structure to contain the coordinates might not be the same between translations, so check the sample test cases provided.</p>
