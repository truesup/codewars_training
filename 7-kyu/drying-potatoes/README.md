Potatoes contain water and dry matter. The water content is 99 percent of the total weight. He thinks they are too wet and puts them in an oven - at low temperature - for them to lose some water. </p><p>At the output the water content is only 98%.</p><p>What is the total weight in kilograms (water content plus dry matter) coming out of the oven?</p><p>He finds 50 kilograms and he thinks he made a mistake: "So much weight lost for such a small change in water content!"</p><p>Can you help him?</p><h4 id="task">Task</h4><p>Write function <code>potatoes</code> with </p><ul><li>int parameter <code>p0</code> - initial percent of water- </li><li>int parameter <code>w0</code> - initial weight - </li><li>int parameter <code>p1</code> - final percent of water -</li></ul><p><code>potatoes</code>should return the final weight coming out of the oven <code>w1</code> truncated as an int.</p><h4 id="example">Example:</h4><p><code>potatoes(99, 100, 98) --&gt; 50</code></p>
