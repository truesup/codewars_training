You don't need to check whether the input is a valid number because only valid numbers are used in the tests.  </p><p>Don't round the numbers! Just cut them after two decimal places!</p><pre><code>Right examples:  32.8493 is 32.84  14.3286 is 14.32Incorrect examples (e.g. if you round the numbers):  32.8493 is 32.85  14.3286 is 14.33</code></pre>
