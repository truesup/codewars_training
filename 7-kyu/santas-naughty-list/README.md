Go through a list of children, and return a list containing every child who appeared on Santa's list. Do not add any child more than once. Output should be sorted.</p><p>Comparison should be case sensitive and the returned list should contain only one copy of each name: <code>"Sam"</code> and <code>"sam"</code> are different, but <code>"sAm"</code> and <code>"sAm"</code> are not.</p>
