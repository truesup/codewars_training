You realise that in order to make significant steps quickly, it would help to go to a coding bootcamp in London.</p><p>Problem is, many of them cost a fortune, and those that don't still involve a significant amount of time off work - who will pay your mortgage?!</p><p>To offset this risk, you decide that rather than leaving work totally, you will request a sabbatical so that you can go back to work post bootcamp and be paid while you look for your next role.</p><p>You need to approach your boss. Her decision will be based on three parameters:<br></p><p><code>val</code> = your value to the organisation<br><code>happiness</code> = her happiness level at the time of asking and finally<br>The numbers of letters from 'sabbatical' that are present in string <code>s</code>.</p><p>Note that if <code>s</code> contains three instances of the letter 'l', that still scores three points, even though there is only one in the word sabbatical.</p><p>If the sum of the three parameters (as described above) is &gt; 22, return 'Sabbatical! Boom!', else return 'Back to your desk, boy.'.</p>
