The new item can be any object, and it does not matter. (lets say you add an integer value, like 13)</p><p>In our test case we check to assure that the returned list has one more item than the input list. However the method needs some modification to pass this test.</p><p>P.S. You have to create a new list and add a new item to that. (This Kata is originally designed for C# language and it shows that adding a new item to the input list is not going to work, even though the parameter is passed by value, but the value is poining to the <strong>reference</strong> of list and any change on parameter will be seen by caller)</p>
